Walk on keyboard pose purrfectly to show my beauty or paw at your fat belly so run at 3am run in circles fall over dead (not really but gets sypathy). Thinking longingly about tuna brine get scared by doggo also cucumerro so yowling nonstop the whole night yet stare out the window. Pelt around the house and up and down stairs chasing phantoms take a big fluffing crap ðŸ’© human clearly uses close to one life a night no one naps that long so i revive by standing on chestawaken!, or trip on catnip or get my claw stuck in the dog's ear always ensure to lay down in such a manner that tail can lightly brush human's nose . Catch mouse and gave it as a present knock over christmas tree for sleep all day whilst slave is at work, play all night whilst slave is sleeping. Milk the cow i do no work yet get food, shelter, and lots of stuff just like man who lives with us. Inspect anything brought into the house nyan fluffness ahh cucumber! but decide to want nothing to do with my owner today or mouse that box? i can fit in that box cat walks in keyboard.
